Not completely satisfied or ordered the wrong size/colour? You can return any unworn items (in their original condition) within 28 days of receiving your order for a full refund.

Our returns process is simple, just use the returns note in your parcel and follow the steps below:
<br />
<b>Returns by Post</b><br />
Complete and detach the returns note on the right of your delivery note and enclose it in your package. We need this information to refund you. If you don't have a returns note anymore, please contact us so that we can help you.<br />
Remove any old labels and barcodes from the outside of the parcel.<br />
Attach the new label to the front of your package with the following address details in our contact page.<br />

									<p><b>When will I receive my refund?</b><br />

As soon as the returns are received at our warehouse, they will be automatically refunded within 28 days (from the day you sent your return parcel) to the method of payment used for the order.<br />

You'll receive a confirmation email when the item has been refunded. If you paid by card, please make sure you check your bank statement from the date of the order onwards, as your refund may be shown against the order date.<br />

If you paid using another payment method, please check with the payment provider/issuer to locate the refund.<br />

<b>I haven't received my refund</b><br />

You'll receive a confirmation email when the item has been refunded. If you paid by card, please make sure you check your bank statement from the date of the order onwards, as your refund may be shown against the order date.<br />

If you made your original payment with a card that is now expired or cancelled, please contact your bank. The refund will always be processed to your original method of payment and can't be sent to another card.<br />

If you paid using another payment method, please contact the payment provider/issuer to locate the refund.<br />

Please keep your returns tracking number until you receive your refund - you may be asked to provide this if we've not received your item(s). If you didn't choose a tracked service for the return and only have a postage receipt, you'll need to file a claim with the postal service directly. </p>
